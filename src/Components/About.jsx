                        I've spend a few years working on Chemical industry, in my occupation I had to
                        learn new things and solve problems everyday and I liked it
                        but I decided to get back at University to explore deeper worlds.
                        Currently I am in last year of undergraduate at Universit√© de Haute-Alsace (France)
                        working on meaningful projects with local companies.
